# Humanizer Integration - humanly v2.0 🦅

## What Changed

**humanly v2.0** now includes automatic humanization of all outputs using the **humanizer skill** from [@blader](https://github.com/blader/humanizer).

Every piece of content generated by humanly is now automatically processed through a 24-pattern AI detection and removal system, then enhanced with soul and personality.

---

## The Problem humanly v1 Had

Even with our "humanly style" guidelines (no hype, no FOMO, story-driven), AI-generated content still showed patterns:

- "Additionally..." everywhere
- "serves as" instead of "is"
- Rule of three (always groups of 3 items)
- Em dash overuse
- Generic conclusions ("The future looks bright")
- Lack of personality and soul

**Result:** Content was better than raw AI, but still sounded... algorithmic.

---

## The Solution: Integrated Humanizer

Now every output goes through a two-phase process:

### Phase 1: humanly Transformation
- Story-driven
- No hype, no FOMO
- Pure value and wisdom
- Soft, simple language

### Phase 2: Humanizer Post-Processing
- **Removes 24 AI patterns** (see list below)
- **Adds soul and personality**
- Varies sentence structure
- Injects opinions and feelings
- Acknowledges complexity
- Makes it sound like a real human wrote it

---

## 24 AI Patterns Removed

### Content Patterns
1. **Significance inflation** - "pivotal moment", "testament to", "crucial role"
2. **Notability name-dropping** - Listing sources without context
3. **Superficial -ing analyses** - "symbolizing", "reflecting", "showcasing"
4. **Promotional language** - "nestled", "vibrant", "boasts"
5. **Vague attributions** - "Experts believe", "Industry reports"
6. **Formulaic challenges** - "Despite challenges... continues to thrive"

### Language Patterns
7. **AI vocabulary** - "Additionally", "crucial", "landscape", "showcase"
8. **Copula avoidance** - "serves as" → "is", "features" → "has"
9. **Negative parallelisms** - "It's not just X, it's Y"
10. **Rule of three** - Always grouping in threes
11. **Synonym cycling** - "protagonist... main character... hero..."
12. **False ranges** - "from X to Y" when just listing

### Style Patterns
13. **Em dash overuse** - Too many — in sentences
14. **Boldface overuse** - **Everything** is **bold**
15. **Inline-header lists** - Repetitive structure
16. **Title Case Headings** - Wrong Capitalization
17. **Emojis** - 🚀 🎯 💡 everywhere
18. **Curly quotes** - Smart quotes instead of straight

### Communication Patterns
19. **Chatbot artifacts** - "I hope this helps!"
20. **Cutoff disclaimers** - "While details are limited..."
21. **Sycophantic tone** - "Great question! You're absolutely right!"

### Filler and Hedging
22. **Filler phrases** - "In order to", "Due to the fact that"
23. **Excessive hedging** - "could potentially possibly"
24. **Generic conclusions** - Vague wrap-ups

---

## Soul and Personality Added

Beyond just removing bad patterns, humanizer adds human qualities:

### What It Adds:
- **Opinions** - "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this"
- **Varied rhythm** - Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that flow.
- **Complexity** - Acknowledging mixed feelings and uncertainty
- **First person** - Using "I" when it fits the voice
- **Specific feelings** - Not "concerning" but "unsettling"
- **Natural mess** - Tangents, asides, half-formed thoughts

### Before (Clean but Soulless):
> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were skeptical. The implications remain unclear.

### After (Has a Pulse):
> I genuinely don't know how to feel about this one. 3 million lines of code, generated while the humans presumably slept. Half the dev community is losing their minds, half are explaining why it doesn't count. The truth is probably somewhere boring in the middle - but I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.

## Usage

### Using humanly v2

The new version is `humanly_v2`. All usage is the same, but outputs are now humanized:

```bash
# Twitter thread (auto-humanized)
./humanly_v2 "https://example.com/article" twitter

# LinkedIn post (auto-humanized)
./humanly_v2 "https://reddit.com/r/..." linkedin

# Blog post (auto-humanized)
./humanly_v2 "https://..." blog

# All formats (all auto-humanized)
./humanly_v2 "https://..." all
```

### Output Comparison

The same URL will now produce **noticeably different** output:

**humanly v1 output:**
> Additionally, the key insight from this article is that parallel git worktrees serve as a powerful productivity tool. This approach represents a significant shift in how developers can work, showcasing the potential for enhanced workflows.

**humanly v2 output (with humanizer):**
> Here's what stood out: running 3-4 git worktrees in parallel actually works. Sounds chaotic - and it is at first - but you get used to it. One session writes features, another handles tests. You stop context-switching between branches. Simple change, noticeable difference.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

1. **Input:** URL provided by user
2. **Fetch:** Content extracted from URL (web_fetch)
3. **Transform:** humanly style applied (story-driven, no hype)
4. **Humanize:** 24 patterns removed + soul added (humanizer)
5. **Output:** Final humanized content saved to file

### Integration Method

The humanizer is embedded directly into the humanly_v2 script as a second-phase prompt. When the OpenClaw agent processes a request:

1. Phase 1: Generate content in humanly style
2. Phase 2: Pass output through humanizer prompt
3. Result: Doubly-processed, ultra-human content

### Files Changed

```
~/humanly/
├── humanly            # Original v1 (preserved)
├── humanly_v2         # New version with humanizer
├── humanizer/
│   └── SKILL.md       # Humanizer skill documentation
├── HUMANIZER_INTEGRATION.md  # This file
└── output/            # Generated content (humanized)
```

## When to Use Which Version

### Use humanly v1 when:
- You want faster generation (one-phase only)
- You plan to heavily edit the output anyway
- Testing or experimentation

### Use humanly v2 when:
- Final content for posting (production use)
- You want the most natural-sounding output
- Building your personal brand (quality matters)
- **Recommended for all real use**

---

## Results & Impact

### Before Integration
- Content was better than raw AI
- Still showed AI patterns occasionally
- Needed manual editing to sound "real"
- Lacked personality and soul

### After Integration
- Content sounds genuinely human-written
- No detectable AI patterns
- Minimal editing required
- Has personality, opinions, and soul
- **Ready to post with minor tweaks**

## Examples

### Example 1: Technical Content

**Source:** Article about git worktrees

**humanly v1:**
> The concept of git worktrees serves as a powerful productivity tool for developers. Additionally, by leveraging multiple parallel sessions, teams can significantly enhance their workflow efficiency, marking a pivotal shift in modern development practices.

**humanly v2 (with humanizer):**
> Git worktrees clicked for me after using them for a week. Three parallel checkouts - one for the feature, one for tests, one for reviewing. Feels weird at first. Then you realize you haven't switched branches in two hours and shipped three PRs. Not revolutionary, just better.

---

### Example 2: Industry Commentary

**Source:** Blog post about AI coding assistants

**humanly v1:**
> The rise of AI coding assistants represents a significant transformation in the software development landscape. These tools showcase the potential for enhanced productivity, highlighting the crucial role they play in modern workflows.

**humanly v2 (with humanizer):**
> AI coding assistants are useful and kind of weird. They're good at boilerplate - the stuff nobody wants to write anyway. They're bad at knowing when they're wrong. I've accepted suggestions that compiled perfectly and did the completely wrong thing because I stopped paying attention. Useful tool. Not a replacement for thinking.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Quick Switch

```bash
# Make v2 the default
cd ~/humanly
mv humanly humanly_v1_backup
ln -s humanly_v2 humanly

# Now 'humanly' uses v2 with humanizer
./humanly "https://..." linkedin
```

### Or Keep Both

```bash
# Use v1 (fast, one-phase)
./humanly "URL" platform

# Use v2 (humanized, two-phase)
./humanly_v2 "URL" platform
```

---

**Result:** humanly content that sounds genuinely human. No AI patterns, full of personality, ready to post.
