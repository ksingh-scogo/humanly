# humanly Style Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Story-Driven
- Start with a relatable scenario or observation
- Use narrative arc (setup → insight → resolution)
- Make abstract concepts concrete through examples
- End with a reflection or question

### 2. No Hype, No FOMO
❌ **Avoid:**
- "Revolutionary"
- "Game-changing"
- "You MUST see this"
- "Don't miss out"
- "Everyone is talking about..."
- Excessive exclamation marks!!!

✅ **Use instead:**
- "I noticed..."
- "This reminded me..."
- "Worth thinking about..."
- "Here's what stood out..."

### 3. Pure Value
- Lead with insight, not promotion
- Share lessons, not achievements
- Give practical takeaways
- Make it actionable

### 4. Soft, Simple Language
❌ **Avoid:**
- Jargon: "synergistic paradigm shift"
- Corporate speak: "leverage core competencies"
- Technical mumbo-jumbo (unless explaining it)
- Complex sentence structures

✅ **Use instead:**
- Short sentences
- Common words
- Active voice
- Conversational tone

### 5. Humanly Tone
Think: **wise friend over coffee**, not:
- Marketing exec in boardroom
- Professor in lecture hall
- Sales rep on call

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Twitter/X Threads

**Structure:**
```
Tweet 1: Hook (observation or question)
Tweet 2-4: Key insights (one per tweet)
Tweet 5: Takeaway or reflection
```

**Example:**
```
1/ I watched how experienced developers debug code.

2/ They don't immediately add console.logs everywhere.
   They pause. They read. They think.

3/ The best debuggers I've seen spend 80% of their time 
   understanding the problem, 20% fixing it.

4/ It's counterintuitive. We want to DO something.
   But understanding IS doing.

5/ Next time something breaks, try this:
   - Read the error message completely
   - Trace the code path mentally
   - Form a hypothesis
   Only then start debugging.
```

### LinkedIn Posts

**Structure:**
```
1. Opening hook (personal anecdote or observation)
2. The insight or lesson
3. Why it matters
4. Practical application
5. Closing reflection or question
```

**Tone:**
- Professional but warm
- Vulnerable when appropriate
- Helpful, not preachy
- Include personal experience

**Length:** 1500-2500 characters ideal

**Example:**
```
I used to think "senior developer" meant knowing more APIs.

Last week, I watched our new senior engineer onboard. She asked more 
questions than our interns. "Why did we choose this architecture?" 
"What problem were we solving?" "Who uses this feature?"

The difference wasn't knowledge. It was curiosity.

Junior developers often try to prove they belong by having answers. 
Senior developers know the right questions unlock better solutions.

This applies beyond coding. In product meetings, marketing strategy, 
customer calls - the person asking "why?" and "what if?" usually adds 
the most value.

We confuse confidence with competence. Real competence is being 
comfortable saying "I don't know yet, but let me understand this better."

What's one question you wish you'd asked earlier in your career?
```

### Blog Posts

**Structure:**
```
1. Title (curiosity-driven, not clickbait)
2. Opening story or observation
3. Main insights (2-4 sections)
4. Practical examples
5. Actionable takeaways
6. Closing reflection
```

**Tone:**
- Conversational (use "you" and "we")
- Educational but not condescending
- Include personal failures/learnings
- Make it scannable (headers, short paragraphs)

**Length:** 800-1500 words

## Voice Characteristics

### What makes it "humanly"?

✅ **Authentic**
- Share what you actually learned, not what sounds impressive

- Give away insights freely
- No "click here to learn more"
- Complete thoughts, not teasers

✅ **Reflective**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ The Humble Brag
"Just closed a $10M round. Remember, keep grinding!"
- Focuses on achievement, not insight
- Hollow advice
- Self-promotional

### ✅ The Insight Share
"Investors asked 'why now?' 47 times in our fundraising meetings. 
Took me a while to realize: they weren't questioning our timing, 
they were asking about market readiness. Different question entirely."
- Specific observation
- Genuine learning
- Helpful to others

### ❌ The Guru Voice
"Here are 10 secrets the top 1% know..."
- Creates artificial scarcity
- Positions you as superior
- FOMO-driven

- Position as fellow learner
- Invites others to explore
- Curiosity-driven

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Would I send this to a friend?
- [ ] Does it provide genuine value?
- [ ] Is it specific (not generic advice)?
- [ ] Does it tell a story or share an insight?
- [ ] Is the language simple and clear?
- [ ] Does it sound like me (human), not ChatGPT?
- [ ] Would I read this if someone else wrote it?
- [ ] Does it avoid hype/FOMO/clickbait?

## The "humanly" Test

If your content could've been written by:
- A corporate marketing team → ❌ Not humanly
- An AI with no personality → ❌ Not humanly
- A friend sharing something interesting → ✅ humanly

Remember: The goal isn't to go viral. The goal is to add value in your authentic voice, consistently.

Quality over quantity. Wisdom over hype. Humanity over algorithms.
