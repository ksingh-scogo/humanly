## Output

---

1/ I added a --dry-run flag to my app on a whim. Ended up using it every single day for months.

2/ You know that feeling before running a command that might break something? That split second of "wait, did I check everything?"

3/ --dry-run removes that feeling entirely. It shows what WOULD happen, without actually doing it. Safe to run anytime, no thinking required.

4/ Here's what surprised me: I used it more for confidence than debugging. A quick sanity check before starting work. "Is everything where it should be? Config correct? State makes sense?"

5/ The cost? A few if (dryRun) checks in the code. The benefit? Instant feedback on behavior changes without waiting for actual execution.

6/ Not every app needs this. But command-line tools that create/modify things? It's a small feature that removes a lot of mental overhead.

7/ Sometimes the best tools aren't fancy algorithms. They're just thoughtful safety nets that let you move faster because you're less afraid of breaking things.
